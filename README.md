Because the code in our problems was evolved till it worked with specific deep-learning-concept related learning objectives, it is often not good code from the perspective of being exemplary from a software engineering  point of view. For example, it is often not very pythonic, etc. You can, ideally with AI assistance that you document carefully vis-a-vis process, take one of the coding problems/demos and refactor it as well as update the code to follow good documented software engineering and ML Engineering processes. Here, we expect you to give citations to the relevant points of good style and document your changes in a report. The constraint is that the problem code shouldn't lose any of its teaching value --- just be transformed to have good coding practices and style. As always, deconfliction is a must however this can be a group effort by up to three people.
